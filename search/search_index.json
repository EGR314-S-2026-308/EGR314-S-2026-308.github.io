If we need to update in the future it will be because a team member is not fulfilling the letter and spirit of their role and will be communicated during team meetings. This deficit in action could be noticed by an increasing lack of communication, reviews, or participation as the role describes. At this point we will reevaluate to see if they are better suited for another role or if we can create a plan to help correct the deficit.
