That is to say we want to protect humans from risk of injury in environments that pose a threat like water pressure in the ocean. A more self evident goal to gather data regarding that environment and secondarily protect it from further disturbance. Finally due to the nature of our proposed environment, the ocean, we want our device to be able not only withstand significant external pressures but also gather detailed environments.</p> <p>At this stage of development, we have identified several groups that would be interested in this project. As the project is developed within a university engineering group, the primary target audience is university personnel, including faculty, researchers, and students. A secondary audience includes industry professionals who may encounter the prototype through in-person demonstrations. Additionally, research and exploratory groups may be exposed to the project through industry connections, expanding its reach beyond the academic environment.</p>  Idea Generation    1.

This deficit in action could be noticed by an increasing lack of communication, reviews, or participation as the role describes. At this point we will reevaluate to see if they are better suited for another role or if we can create a plan to help correct the deficit.
