At the current time, we are not planning on cycling through roles as during our initial meeting we sat down to see where everyone's strengths lay. If we need to update in the future it will be because a team member is not fulfilling the letter and spirit of their role and will be communicated during team meetings. This deficit in action could be noticed by an increasing lack of communication, reviews, or participation as the role describes. At this point we will reevaluate to see if they are better suited for another role or if we can create a plan to help correct the deficit. As for helping, team members are welcome to help each other achieve sections, but if requested to allow someone to work solo will respect that decision.

## Communication Channels

### Team Communication Method

>This is an area where teams often get into trouble. You should specific the channel(s)/method(s) for the team communication along with notes on the expectation in response time.

Table 3: Team Members' Preferred Communication Modes

| **Name** | **First Choice Communication** | **Second Choice Communication** | **Third Choice Communication** |
|:---------|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Adrian   |                                |                                 |                                |
| Sam M    |                                |                                 |                                |
| Sam B    | Discord                        | Text/Group chat                 | Instagram                      |
| Andrew   | Text/Group Chat                | Discord                         | Instagram                      |
| Jacob    | Discord                        | Text/Group chat                 | Instagram                      |

### Communication Procedures

Then, answer the following question as a team:

* Discord was the agreed upon form of communication and as such will be on a dedicated server with specified channels for quick access of information.  <!-- It is expected a response of ... on the agreed timeframe of .... -->
* Team leader, Adrian P, will be the point of contact for instructor correspondence. As such he is responsible for asking the questions the group needs for successful project completion if an email is required. Through email chains either he can CC group members or bring the response back to the discord server.

### Meeting Schedule and Coordination

>Your team should identify common times for meeting every week. If you are not meeting weekly, your team's chances of success this semester are low

* Team will meet Wednesday's 8 o'clock - 9 o' clock on a virtual meeting. Reminders will be communicated through the discord channel with a ping as we're getting closer to the meeting and any changes will also have a resultant ping to ensure individuals get a notification.
* For records of accountability attendance and assigned tasks will be noted in the minutes. As for any accountability issues first we want to find out where the breakdown in capability or communication occurred, create a plan to fix that problem, and then if further problems persist we can elevate to the teaching team.

### Team Coordination & Accountability

* Assignments are submitted after a discord poll has the team's sign off or by 11:50 pm before assignments are due (assumes a 11:59 pm due time).
* To Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required, the team will trust in the individual's ability to advocate for themselves and promote an environment where asking for help is encouraged.
* Feedback is to be constructive and acted on within a week of receiving the feedback.
* Missed contributions/assignments/actions will be noted and follow a similar path as the accountability issues aforementioned.
  <!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NEED to WORK PAST HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
* Hold one another accountable to the expectations described in this charter.
* Recognize that a team member is underperforming.
* Help an underperforming team member improve.
* What are the consequences if an underperforming team member does not improve (e.g., pink slip)?

#### Conflict Recognition & Resolution

> List the steps and means of documenting issues that lead to involving the instructor in a "Pink Slip" processor. It is best to be **proactive** in resolving these issues early in the semester!
