Table 1: Project Roles and Duties

| **Role**          | **Duties**                                                                                                                                |

| Assignment leader | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date                                                           |
| Project monitor   | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status |
| Quality control   | Checks assignments over with Assignment leader to ensure the material is of a quality we deem worthy of the 314 project                   |

Table 2: Team Member and Roles

| **Team Member** | **Role** |
| :-------------- | :----------- |
| Adrian P | Team leader |
| Sam M | Meeting recorder |
| Jacob D | Assignment Leader |
| Sam B | Project monitor |
| Andrew I | Quality control |

At the current time, we are not planning on cycling through roles as during our initial meeting we sat down to see where everyone's strengths lay. If we need to update in the future it will be because a team member is not fulfilling the letter and spirit of their role and will be communicated during team meetings. This deficit in action could be noticed by an increasing lack of communication, reviews, or participation as the role describes. At this point we will reevaluate to see if they are better suited for another role or if we can create a plan to help correct the deficit. As for helping, team members are welcome to help each other achieve sections, but if requested to allow someone to work solo will respect that decision.

## Communication Channels

### Team Communication Method

>This is an area where teams often get into trouble. You should specific the channel(s)/method(s) for the team communication along with notes on the expectation in response time.

Table 3: Team Members' Preferred Communication Modes

| **Name** | **First Choice Communication** | **Second Choice Communication** | **Third Choice Communication** |
|:---------|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Adrian P | Discord                        | Text/Group chat                 | Instagram                      |
| Sam M    | Discord                        | Text/Group chat                 | Instagram                      |
| Jacob D  | Discord                        | Text/Group chat                 | Instagram                      |
| Sam B    | Discord                        | Text/Group chat                 | Instagram                      |
| Andrew I | Text/Group Chat                | Discord                         | Instagram                      |

### Communication Procedures

Then, answer the following question as a team:

* Discord was the agreed-upon form of communication and, as such, will be on a dedicated server with specified channels for quick access to information.  <!-- It is expected a response of ... on the agreed timeframe of .... -->
* Team leader, Adrian P, will be the point of contact for instructor correspondence. As such, he is responsible for asking the questions the group needs to ensure successful project completion, if an email is required. Through email chains, he can either CC group members or bring the response back to the Discord server.

### Meeting Schedule and Coordination

>Your team should identify common times for meeting every week. If you are not meeting weekly, your team's chances of success this semester are low

* Team will meet Wednesday's 8 o'clock - 9 o' clock on a virtual meeting. Reminders will be communicated through the discord channel with a ping as we're getting closer to the meeting and any changes will also have a resultant ping to ensure individuals get a notification.
* For records of accountability attendance and assigned tasks will be noted in the minutes. As for any accountability issues first we want to find out where the breakdown in capability or communication occurred, create a plan to fix that problem, and then if further problems persist we can elevate to the teaching team.

### Team Coordination & Accountability

* Assignments are submitted after a discord poll has the team's sign off or by 11:50 pm before assignments are due (assumes a 11:59 pm due time).
* To Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required, the team will trust in the individual's ability to advocate for themselves and promote an environment where asking for help is encouraged.
* Feedback is to be constructive and acted on within a week of receiving the feedback.
* Missed contributions/assignments/actions will be noted and follow a similar path as the accountability issues aforementioned.
* Hold one another accountable by reviewing assignments before submission and ensuring each team members work meets the team expectation of quality.
* Recognizing that a team member is underperforming will be indicated by missing contributions or minimal/low quality work on consecutive team assignments.
* Help an underperforming team member improve by identifying the areas they're struggling in creating a plan to improve going forward and possibly reassigning work to an area they're more confident in.
* The consequences for an underperforming team member will be questioning from the team and a verbal "slap" on the wrist and if the problem persist possibly escalating to a pink slip

#### Conflict Recognition & Resolution
<!--
> List the steps and means of documenting issues that lead to involving the instructor in a "Pink Slip" processor. It is best to be **proactive** in resolving these issues early in the semester!
-->
Issues include missed deadlines, incomplete work, poor-quality work, absent team members, and unfulfilled responsibilities. Any team member can raise an issue, but only if it concerns an agent and is based on observations made through assets.

The first stage involves discussing the issue within the team, either at an all-team meeting or one-on-one, to clarify expectations and identify the underlying cause – task burden, skill gap, or noted issues. If no resolution emerges, the concern is documented immediately in the Meeting Agendas by the Meeting Recorder and becomes an agenda item for the future.

An expectation of improvement and a proposed corrective plan are presented. This stage is expected to be resolved at the moment of truth meeting, at most a week from discovery. If not resolved, the team provides assistance, such as redistributing tasks, offering tips, or optional role changes.

If the situation remains unresolved, the team returns to the meeting minutes and documents the issue again. If the concern is not resolved within the escalated time frame, the team leader substantiates the issue, which results in a separate deduction, compares it with the rest of the forces, logs it in the issue tracker, and sends a notification to the instructor via email.
