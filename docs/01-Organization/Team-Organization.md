## Charters

> "ASU is a comprehensive public research university, measured not by whom it excludes, but by whom it includes and how they succeed; advancing research and discovery of public value; and assuming fundamental responsibility for the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves." (ASU's Charter)

>"Team 308 is a collaborative group of ASU undergraduate students, measured not by prior experience, but by our commitment to learning, innovation, and task completion. We strive to expand our collective knowledge, apply interdisciplinary problem-solving, and design a functional prototype that addresses real-world challenges, with a focus on underwater research and exploration."

The team came about this team charter by applying our understanding of the ASU charter and seeking a way to build that into a more team specific and class specific charter. This allowed us to work in some of the communicated ideas for the EGR 314 (Spring 2026) course. We primarily focused on the interdisciplinary nature of the project for a real-world challenge.

## Product Mission Statement

 308's mission is to offer a water-based exploratory solution to allow users to further understand changes over time and monitor environments from a nearby position.
