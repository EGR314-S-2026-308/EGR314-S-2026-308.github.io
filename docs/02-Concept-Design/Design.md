title: Concept Generation and Design Ideation
---

## Framework

The goals are device are as broad as they are complex. That is to say we want to protect humans from risk of injury in environments that pose a threat like water pressure in the ocean. A more self evident goal to gather data regarding that environment and secondarily protect it from further disturbance. Finally due to the nature of our proposed environment, the ocean, we want our device to be able not only withstand significant external pressures but also gather detailed environments.

At this stage of development, we have identified several groups that would be interested in this project. As the project is developed within a university engineering group, the primary target audience is university personnel, including faculty, researchers, and students. A secondary audience includes industry professionals who may encounter the prototype through in-person demonstrations. Additionally, research and exploratory groups may be exposed to the project through industry connections, expanding its reach beyond the academic environment.

## Concepts
1. Rugged Industrial Surveyor
<br>
![Rugged Industrial Surveyor](Sources/AndrewConcept.svg)
This is a structure that will withstand pressure with its components sealed in a waterproof enclosure made of corrosion-resistant materials. It is designed for "long-term water and pressure exposure."
It includes a wide frame metal cage to help keep the rover from environmental harm and marie predators. It is designed to optimize strength and safety to the components 
<br>
The rovers antenna na provides wireless communication between the rover and the user. This eliminates the need for any physical buttons and screens that can compromise durability and strength under water.when in operation, it uses its sensor probes and an actuator based response system to navigate its way through the ocean, avoiding obstacles and logging data.
<br>
To improve durability of the rover, all user controls will be made by wireless communication and pre-coded operations. Instructions will come in the form of manuals and online videos available of the control app. Any change to the device will require a disassembly of the enclosure to get into the components, reducing the ease of modification and control but improving the overall structural integrity of the rover.
