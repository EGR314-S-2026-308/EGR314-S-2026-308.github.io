title: Concept Generation and Design Ideation

## Framework

Two paragraphs What is the goal of our devices, who is the audience

Goals: prevent risk to human life, gather environmental data, protect the environment that we wish to explore, research marine life

    The goals are device are as broad as they are complex. That is to say we want to protect humans from risk of injury in environments that pose a threat like water pressure in the ocean. A more self evident goal to gather data regarding that environment and secondarily protect it from further disturbance. Finally due to the nature of our proposed environment, the ocean, we want our device to be able not only withstand significant external pressures but also gather detailed environments.

Audience: exploring groups, researchers, research foundations, and universities

    At this stage of development, we have identified several groups that would be interested in this project. As the project is developed within a university engineering group, the primary target audience is university personnel, including faculty, researchers, and students. A secondary audience includes industry professionals who may encounter the prototype through in-person demonstrations. Additionally, research and exploratory groups may be exposed to the project through industry connections, expanding its reach beyond the academic environment.

## Idea Generation

## Concepts

## Selected Concepts

<!-- Describe, after each presented concept:

How the features highlighted in your concept sketch satisfy the needs of the user of the exploration device.
How the functionality will will be split across four teammates (See the project description)

Internet-based Two-way wireless communication
Human machine interface via a screen and buttons
Sensor and Actuator-based controlled response
In this passage, please justify how your concept satisfies the following questions:

What kinds of cues will you provide to make the use of your device easier?

How do you plan on designing your "controls?"
What role will durability and comfort play in the user experience?
What kind of instruction will be needed to use the device?
